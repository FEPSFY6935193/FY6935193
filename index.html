  <h3 id="Abstract">Abstract</h3>
  <p>
   Mass producing Pharmaceutical products is a key step in human development as it allows for fast, easy access to life saving medicines. As the population increases globally, there is an increasing need for ease of access to certain chemicals / medicines. This places a lot of stress on Pharmaceutical companies to streamline the process of manufacturing and supplying these products. This paper will demonstrate the key aspects of how large scale manufacturing has improved and changed and will show how mass producing pharmaceuticals is key for our development and survival as a species.

  <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    Pharmaceutical production has evolved from a small-batch, labor intensive process to a highly automated, globally integrated system capable of producing many doses anually. While we have improved our ability to mass produce medicines, we are still far off being able to supply the entire world with enough to end most curable disease that still plague many underdeveloped nations. For example, according to "Partners in Health", Cholera kills anywhere from 21,000 to 143,000 people each year. Cholera is an easily treatable disease, with less than 1% of patients dying after being rehydrated shortly after being diagnosed. These death are almost all in the developing world, where access to the correct medications (such as rehydration solutions) is much lower due to a lack of ability to produce enough, which in turn raises the cost meaning people cannot afford them.

    However, recent innovations - mainly during the COVID 19 pandemic - have shown we are capable of producing enough medicines and vaccines to provide developing countries with the aid required, but only when it suits the developed world (i.e. solving a global crisis).
