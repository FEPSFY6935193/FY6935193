  <h3 id="Abstract">Abstract</h3>
  <p>
   Mass producing Pharmaceutical products is a key step in human development as it allows for fast, easy access to life saving medicines. As the population increases globally, there is an increasing need for ease of access to certain chemicals / medicines. This places a lot of stress on Pharmaceutical companies to streamline the process of manufacturing and supplying these products. This paper will demonstrate the key aspects of how large scale manufacturing has improved and changed and will show how mass producing pharmaceuticals is key for our development and survival as a species.
  </p>
  <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    Pharmaceutical production has evolved from a small-batch, labor intensive process to a highly automated, globally integrated system capable of producing many doses anually. While we have improved our ability to mass produce medicines, we are still far off being able to supply the entire world with enough to end most curable disease that still plague many underdeveloped nations. For example, according to These 5 Diseases are treatable. They Kill Millions (Partners In Health, 2023), Cholera kills anywhere from 21,000 to 143,000 people each year(1). Cholera is an easily treatable disease, with less than 1% of patients dying after being rehydrated shortly after being diagnosed. These death are almost all in the developing world, where access to the correct medications (such as rehydration solutions) is much lower due to a lack of ability to produce enough, which in turn raises the cost meaning people cannot afford them.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, recent innovations - mainly during the COVID 19 pandemic - have shown we are capable of producing enough medicines and vaccines to provide developing countries with the aid required, but only when it suits the developed world (i.e. solving a global crisis).
  </p>
  <h3 id="Analysis and discussion">Analysis and discussion</h3>
  <p>
    There are a few factors that affect the ability to manufacture pharmaceuticals on a global scale, and a few technological advancements that have made it easier:
  </p>
  <p>
    The first factor is Batch vs. Continuous manufacturing. Traditional batch manufacturing of medicines remains common, with it still being used to produce specific products (i.e. certain cancer treatments). Batch manufacturing is also cheaper to set up, allowing start up costs to be less but also yielding less overall profit. Continuous manufacturing seems to be far better for drugs such as Ibuprofen that are consumed on a large scale due to cheaper running costs and lower energy consumption, leading to less pollution. Batch vs. Continuous Pharmaceutical Manufacturing (General Kinematics, 2017) states that the industry loses about $50 billion a year due to how inneficient batch processing is(2). 
  </p>
  <p>
    The main advancement in technology that enables easier mass production is the breakthroughs in automation and robotics. This has enabled a more streamlined process due to reduced human error and a greater level of aseptic control (less biological factors to consider). Robots can be used for packaging, sterile filtering (the removal of microbes) and also handling hazardous substances.
  </p>
  <p>
    The final factor that affects the mass production of pharmaceuticals is the lengthy approval process. For example in the US, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) has to approve all pharmaceuticals before they are able to be mass produced and spread across the country. Their approval process goes like this:
    1. Analysis of the target condition and available treatments—FDA reviewers analyze the condition or illness for which the drug is intended and evaluate the current treatment landscape, which provide the context for weighing the drug’s risks and benefits. Development & Approval Process | Drugs (FDA, 2025)
    2. Assessment of benefits and risks from clinical data—FDA reviewers evaluate clinical benefit and risk information submitted by the drug maker, taking into account any uncertainties that may result from imperfect or incomplete data. Development & Approval Process | Drugs (FDA, 2025)
    3. Strategies for managing risks—All drugs have risks. Risk management strategies include an FDA-approved drug label, which clearly describes the drug’s benefits and risks, and how the risks can be detected and managed. Development & Approval Process | Drugs (FDA, 2025)
    While this process may be lengthy, it is necassary to ensure that all drugs are safe for our consumption and will not have adverse side effects.
  </p>
  <p>
    In conclusion, mass production is not yet at the level that it needs to be to ensure that the world is safe from curable diseases. However, I believe that in the next 10 - 20 years that level could definitely be reached. It is essential that we as a species streamline this process as much as possible as it is an important pathway to higher development.
